# mazr
Python script for generating mazes, using a [recursive backtracking algorithm](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking). Mazes are outputted as .txt files. Wall and gap symbols can be altered, but default to '0' for a wall and '-' for an empty space.
Requires Python 3.

Currently only renders square mazes with a minimum width of 5.
